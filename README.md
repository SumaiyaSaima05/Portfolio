## About me
Hello there! I am Sumaiya Saima. I am an Artificial Intelligence Research Engineer currently located in Tokyo, Japan. I have graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology in October,2018. My interests include machine Learning,deep learning, computer vision, robustness analysis,multi-task learning and fairness in machine learning. 


I have been working with the AIQM-reference team in **[National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html)** on behalf of **[Hiperdyne Corporation](https://hiperdyne.com/)** since July,2019. My primary focus is creating in-depth demonstration of quality evaluation of AI products using this **[Machine Learning Quality Management Guideline](https://www.digiarc.aist.go.jp/en/publication/aiqm/)** published by AIST. While creating such technical reports for AI products, my responsibilities include :
 
- Requirement analysis
- Business Requirement Document(BRD) preparation 
- Problem domain analysis
- Exploratory data analysis
- Survey and implementation of relevant AI technologies
- Proof of Concept, and last but not least
- Quality evaluation of the AI product

You can find out more about what our team does from  **[this technical report](https://www.digiarc.aist.go.jp/publication/aiqm/AIQM-reference-2020.pdf)**. <br>
