### Surveys and Paper Summaries

As a part of my work, I often have to survey papers from different domains of Artificial Intelligence. **[This folder](https://github.com/SumaiyaSaima05/Portfolio-Contents/tree/master/Literature%20reviews)** contains summaries of some of the papers I found interesting including topics like:
- Multi-task Learning in AI
- Application of Neural Networks in Partial Differential Equation Solving
- Mutation Testing of Deep Learning Systems
- Neuron Coverage and Robustness Analysis Against Adversarial Attacks
- Corner Case detection Machine Learning Applications
- Fairness Metrics in AI 

### Machine Learning Projects

**[This folder](https://github.com/SumaiyaSaima05/Portfolio-Contents/tree/master/Problem%20solving%20using%20AI)** includes some of my machine learning based projects such as:
- Text classification using k-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes
- Predicting house prices using neural networks
- Decision Tree implementation 
- Predicting Blooming Time of Sakura & analysis of blooming phenomena

### Robotics Projects

I was a Robotics enthusiast during my undergrad years. Find out more about my robotics projects and my undergrad thesis in **[this folder](https://github.com/SumaiyaSaima05/Portfolio-Contents/tree/master/Undergrad%20works)** which includes:
- Gas Leakage Alarm System for Smart Home
- Maze Solving Robot
- Performance analysis of PI controller
